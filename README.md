# Cloudflare Workers Project
I made a fun little app that returns one of two pages on random - 50% of the time the link directs the visitor to a "win" page and 50% of the time the "lose" page. I used Javascript's fetch API, Cloudflare's internal helper classes and also implemented a browser cache that stores which page the user got (so you'll have to go incognito to get the other page).
