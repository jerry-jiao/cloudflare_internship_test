# Cloudflare Workers Internship Application: Full-Stack

## My Submission
In addition to completing the core application project, I did parts 1 and 2 of the extra credit as well (customizing values on the page and implementing cookies). I don't have my own domain so unfortunately wasn't able to do part 3. I also added a button that allowed visiters to visit the other page (since the worker sends one of two pages on random), and I did this by using Cloudflare's HTMLRewriter to add an event listener to the button that would change the cookie when the visitor clicked it.
